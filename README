Emultiplexer
------------

This program accepts data stream on one port and distributes it to clients connecting to another one as it arrives. Useful for live video translations.

Configuration
-------------

Rename emultiplex.conf.example to emultiplex.conf and edit it.

Running
-------

Requirements:

* configerl

./emultiplex.sh [config file]

If config file parameter is not supplied, emultiplex.conf is used

Authentication
--------------

First packet that arrives to socket should be password followed by "\n". `(echo "password" && mystream) | nc myhost myport` works. Note that `echo "password" && echo "payload"` doesn't.
